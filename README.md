# Simple PubSub Model

This is a simple Publish Subscribe model using RabbitMQ with AMQP protocol. This also has spam detection, the publish model will allow only 3 messages per 5 seconds. No external library has been used for parsing the attributes.

### File Structure

The file structure contains 3 files - 

	- Publish.java - Contains the code to publish a message and spam filer.
	- Subscribe.java - Contains the code for channel creation.
	- SpamCounter.log - File to log the spam messages for spam filtering.

### Attributes

-Publisher:
```
 	-p : channel to publish message to 
 	-i : user id publishing the message 
 	-m : the message to be published 
```

 Note: All three attributes are required for publishing a message.

-Subscriber:
```
 	-s : the channel name
 	-i : user id creating the channel
```

 Note: Both the attributes are required for publishing a message.
